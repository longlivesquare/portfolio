                        In this project I created a single page with in page navigation from a top located navbar. I used bootstrap for mobile responsiveness.

                    <p>
                        In this project I created a mockup of a pet store website to learn about bootstrap. I used bootstraps for the layout of the elements on the page.

                        In this project I used what I learned about flexbox to make a mobile friendly website with a space theme. I also used some bootstrap helper classes to help with styling.

                        In this project I implemented the game of Gomoko. It is a game that is essentially the board of Go and the goals of Connect 4. Warning: It is ugly as sin.

            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>
                I have been interested in technology from a young age. My father worked in tech services for Fresno Unified School District. I remember playing games on Proodigy. I wrote a "How To" on changing a hard drive for an assignment in first grade.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began my programming journey in elementary school when we did Logo programming in computer class. As a freshmen in high school I learned BASIC. I knew that I wanted to be a programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, knowing what you want and doing what you want aren't always the same thing. Due to bad study habits I lost focus getting to college. After too many years and too many colleges, I finally got my B.S. in Computer Science from Fresno State.
            </p>
            <p>
                After all that time spent in school, I was a bit burnt out on computers. This combined with my grandma passing away shortly after my graduation, I needed a break. Here I am now, taking some classes at Geekwise getting my confidence back.
